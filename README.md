# Smoothing and Noise Reduction

This is my implementation of the Kuwahara Filter.

I'll try to make everything I can my own only for practice. To compile you need to have OpenCV installed in your computer.

The original paper was presented here:

- Kuwahara, M., et al., Processing of RI-angiocardiographic images, in Digital Processing of Biomedical Images, K. Preston and M. Onoe, Editors. 1976, Plenum Press: New York. p. 187-203.

## Bibliography

Though, I will base heavily on Wikipedia's page, cause that paper is expensive for me right now. I will expand the bibliography as I code:

- [Kuwahara Filter (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwahara_filter).
